# Chaos Monkey Test Framework
WSO2 middleware is usually deployed in a distributed and complex architecture that would ensure service availability with minimum downtime. Simulating possible scenarios where the distributed system can be disrupted and engineering such methods to ensure system availability is a modern day practice known as “chaos engineering”. Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a distributed system in order to build confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.
